I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley. Prior to joining Berkeley I received a B.A. from Carleton College, a Ph.D from NYU, and taught at Cornell.

Most of my current research falls into two (often overlapping) buckets. The first uses formal models and experiments to explore the causes and political consequences of biased beliefs. This work provides some ways to model motivated reasoning (wanting to believe certain things are true), selection neglect (not understanding the biases in observed information), and making simplifying assumptions. The second strand of work focuses on measuring and explaining democracy and democratic change, using a variety of methods.

My older research primarily used formal models to study topics like authoritarian politics, communication, information manipulation, discrimination, criminal justice, and conflict.

I am also an Associate Editor at the [American Journal of Political Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15405907)
