I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley. Prior to joining Berkeley I received a B.A. from Carleton College, a Ph.D from NYU, and taught at Cornell.

Most of my current research uses formal models to explore the causes and political consequences of nonstandard belief formation. I also work on topics like authoritarian politics, communication and information manipulation, and conflict.
